# Building mennää.exe — A Small Game That Taught Me a Lot

mennää.exe started as a tiny experiment. I wasn’t trying to become a game developer or launch some polished indie project. I just wanted to build something end-to-end in Godot, ship it, and learn by doing. That mindset ended up being the whole point.

This post explains how I built the game, the thought process behind its structure, and what I learned along the way. Nothing fancy, nothing over-explained — just the real story behind a small project that made me a better developer.

## Getting Started

Godot appealed to me because it removes friction. I could open the engine, drop a few nodes into a scene, write a script, and see results immediately. That tight feedback loop is addictive. It kept me building instead of planning endlessly.

I didn’t begin with a detailed concept. The game grew from a simple prototype: movement, interaction, a basic loop. Once it felt fun to control, I started layering in the rest.

## Scenes, Nodes, and Keeping Things Modular

The biggest decision — which Godot basically nudges you into — was to break everything into small, independent scenes. Instead of one huge script controlling the whole game, each piece had its own logic.

That structure made iteration fast. If something felt off, I could tweak that one piece without worrying about the rest collapsing. It also kept the project from turning into a bowl of spaghetti.

## Building the Core Gameplay

I focused early on making the player feel responsive. Even simple mechanics feel better when input is snappy and movement is predictable. Godot’s scripting made it easy to experiment with the “feel” of things: acceleration, speed, friction, timing.

Once that was solid, the rest of the gameplay grew around it. Small interactions. Reactions. Simple enemy logic. Rather than building complex systems, I relied on straightforward condition checks and short scripts. Clarity over cleverness.

The surprising part was how often the simplest version of a mechanic ended up being the best one.

## Adding Polish

When the basic loop worked, I spent time polishing the experience. Not big features — just tiny touches that made the game more readable and more satisfying.

Small animations, short effects, and subtle feedback cues made a bigger difference than I expected. It reminded me that polish isn’t the final coat of paint at the end of a project; it’s part of communicating with the player.

## What I Learned

This project taught me several things that transfer directly to my professional work:

- Finishing something small is more valuable than sketching something big.
- If your architecture is clean, iteration becomes effortless.
- Visual debugging forces you to understand your own logic better.
- Cutting features is a skill.
- Shipping builds confidence.

I didn’t make the game to show off technical genius. I made it to practice the entire lifecycle: idea, design, implementation, iteration, and release. That process made me sharper than any tutorial would have.

## Why It’s In My Portfolio

It’s a small project, but that’s exactly why it matters. It shows that I can pick up a new tool, understand it quickly, build something coherent, and actually finish it. It reflects how I work: simple foundation, fast iterations, constant refinement.

mennää.exe is less about the game itself and more about the mindset behind it. It’s the kind of project that reminds me why I like building things in the first place.
