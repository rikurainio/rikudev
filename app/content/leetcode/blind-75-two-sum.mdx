# Two Sum

**Question:** [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=oizxjoit&)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### Thoughts
To solve two sum, we can use a hash map to store the indices of the numbers we have seen so far. Then, for each number in the array, we can check if the complement (target - num) exists in the hash map. If it does, we return the indices of the two numbers. If it doesn't, we add the number to the hash map.

If the nums array was already sorted, we could use a two-pointer approach to find the two numbers that add up to the target.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        // empty and 2len
        if(nums.size() == 0){return {};};
        if(nums.size() == 2){
            if(nums[0]+nums[1]==target){return {0,1};}
            else {return {};}
        }

        // num is more than target it cant be part of the sum
        // num is zero, then the other has to be the target
        // could instantly weed out numbers larger than target

        std::unordered_map<int,int> seen;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            int complement = target - nums[i];

            if(seen.find(complement) != seen.end()){
                return { seen[complement], i};
            }

            seen[nums[i]] = i;
        }

        return {};
    }
};
```
